# anantha

"_anantha_" (infinities) is a gtk theme aimed for **elementary os** desktop (Freya) that deviates the default theme to the '_mac-side_' a bit, but just enough to be refreshing.

### For the best experience

- Pantheon desktop
- Gtk3 latest (elementary os parallel)

Feel free to suggest design ideas and point-out issues :-)
